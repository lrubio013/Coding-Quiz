# Coding-Quiz with WEB APIs

## About
Created a dynamic application that will run a JS quiz when you hit start. 

## How
Made a website that combines HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to make a complete dynamic web application. 
- First I created the HTML to display the elements to the webpage
- Then I added a CSS stylesheet to have a clean and polished look
- Last I created a JavaScript file to make the webpage dynamic by using event listeners, functions, and the local storage

## Resources
